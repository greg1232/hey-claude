"""Decide which of the logged wake-word firings were real, and which weren't.

The speaker writes down every firing (src/wake_log.py). This turns that pile
into labelled training data, using three things in order of how much they
cost:

  1. What happened next.
     Nobody said anything -> almost certainly a mistake. A question that
     got answered -> almost certainly real. The speaker works both of
     these out anyway in the course of answering, so this is free and it
     is the most reliable thing here.

     For a near miss, the equivalent is repetition: one that was followed
     within seconds by a real firing is somebody saying it again because
     the first go was missed. That is a labelled recall failure and nobody
     had to label it.

  2. What Whisper makes of the two seconds that fired — but only in one
     direction. Measured against 80 real recordings, tiny.en transcribes
     the wake word 5% of the time and base.en 16%. It hears "It's hot",
     "Take that", "Great class" — the right rhythm and roughly the right
     vowels, overruled by a language model for which "Claude" is rare and
     "take that" is common.

     So a window that does say Claude is strong evidence it was real, and
     a window that doesn't is no evidence at all. What the transcript is
     good for is the opposite case: Whisper handles ordinary English
     perfectly well, so a window that comes out as a fluent sentence of
     television is evidence the speaker was not being spoken to.

  3. Claude, for the ones still in doubt, told plainly how unreliable the
     window transcript is so it doesn't make the same mistake.

Nothing is thrown away and nothing is overwritten: labels are appended to
the same log, so a bad run can be relabelled and the audio is still there
to listen to.

    python train/label_wakes.py                  label everything new
    python train/label_wakes.py --no-claude      steps 1 and 2 only
    python train/label_wakes.py --show           what's labelled so far

    this runs later, on a laptop, with nothing waiting on it, so it can
    afford small.en or medium.en. That difference is the whole point of
    labelling offline — the judge should be better than the thing it is
    judging, or it only teaches the model its own mistakes.

    Claude can't listen to the audio itself: the API takes text, images and
