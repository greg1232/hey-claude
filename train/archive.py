"""Keep the data, and tie each model to the version it was fitted on.

Not a thing you run. `train/relearn.py` calls this every time it retrains:
the dataset is committed first, the model is fitted, and the commit it came
from is written inside the model file. So `state/hey_claude_whisper.npz`
can always answer "what was I trained on", and the answer is a URL rather
than a date and a hope.

    dataset commit  ->  model, carrying that commit's sha
                    ->  uploaded as models/2026-08-23-a1b2c3d4.npz

Why Hugging Face rather than a folder
-------------------------------------
A dataset repo there is a git repository with large-file storage behind
it, so each retraining is a commit. That answers storage and versioning at
once: you can see what changed between two nights, and go back to exactly
the data a particular model was fitted on.

It also fixes something quietly wrong. The Pi keeps only the most recent
few hundred recordings — a rotating cap, so every new firing deletes an old
one — and the audio behind labels already given was being thrown away.
Archived, they are all kept; the Pi goes on holding only what it needs.

Private
-------
This is not the same as the recordings in `train/real/`. Those are four
people who sat down and said "hey Claude" into a microphone on purpose.
This is two second windows of a living room, caught whenever the detector
fired — dozens an hour with a television on — and it contains whatever was
being said in that room by whoever was in it. Nobody chose to record most
of it. The repository is created private and nothing here can make it
public.

Needs HF_TOKEN in .env, from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens. A
fine-grained token with write access to this one repository is enough, and
is what I would use. Without it, retraining still works and simply says
the model isn't archived.

# Claude Speaker — what woke it

Every time the wake word fired, and every time it nearly did, as recorded
by a reSpeaker XVF3800 array in one living room. Kept so the detector can
be retrained on its own mistakes, and so that every model can say which
version of this it was fitted on.

Written by `train/archive.py` in
[greg1232/hey-claude](https://github.com/greg1232/hey-claude), from
`train/relearn.py`, each time it retrains.
Last updated {datetime.now().astimezone().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M %Z')}.

|---|---|
{chr(10).join(f'| {k} | {v} |' for k, v in counted.items())}

## What is here

- `metadata.csv` — one row per firing, lined up with its recording.
- `wakes/wakes.jsonl` — the log as the speaker writes it, append-only.
- `wakes/vectors.f16` — 768 float16 per firing, in row order. Whisper
  `tiny.en` encoder features, mean and max pooled over the first 100
  frames of a two second window, and what the model is actually fitted on.
  Free to keep: the encoder pass is what fired the wake word.
- `wakes/audio/` — the two seconds that fired, 16 kHz mono. The Pi keeps
  only the most recent few hundred; everything ever uploaded stays here.
- `enrolled/` — somebody teaching it their voice by repeating the phrase.
- `models/` — one per retraining, named for the dataset commit it was
  fitted on. The same sha is inside the file, as `dataset`.

## Labels

`label` is 1 if that really was somebody saying "hey Claude".
`labelled_by` says whether a person listened to it or the machine worked it
out from what happened next. A person's answer overrides the machine's.
