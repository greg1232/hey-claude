"""Put the Claude Speaker on a Raspberry Pi.

Safe to run as many times as you like: it only re-does the parts that
changed. The first run takes several minutes, mostly downloading Python
packages onto the Pi; later runs take seconds.

Your API key travels over the SSH connection and lands in a file only you
can read. It is never printed, and never committed — .env is in .gitignore

# The Pi speaks with Piper, not the macOS `say` command.
# Listen to the choices at https://rhasspy.github.io/piper-samples/
# Keep to a "medium" voice: measured on a Pi 4, medium needs 0.32 seconds
# of compute per second of speech, but "high" needs 2.0 — slower than
# talking, so the speaker would fall behind itself.
PIPER_VOICE=en_GB-alan-medium

# Which microphone and which speaker.
#   python src/audio_in.py --devices     lists microphones
#   python src/tts.py --devices          lists speakers
#
# OUTPUT_DEVICE is set rather than left empty on purpose. A Pi's ALSA
# default is the first HDMI port, and opening it with no monitor plugged in
# fails outright ("audio open error: Unknown error 524") — so the speaker
# would start up and then not be able to say a word. Playing through the
# microphone array is better still when the speakers are wired that way:
# the XVF3800 cancels its own output in hardware.
INPUT_DEVICE=
# Through PipeWire, not straight at the microphone array.
#
# The array allows one program at a time. That was survivable while the
# speaker was the only thing making a noise, and stopped being survivable
# the day librespot started playing music: Spotify took the card, and the
# next thing the speaker tried to say died with "Device unavailable" and
# took the whole program with it.
#
# pipewire-alsa (installed by this script) puts PipeWire in between, so
# music, speech, a story and a timer can all exist at once. It also hands
# back the voice's own 22 kHz instead of the array's 16, so answers stop
# being resampled on the way out.
OUTPUT_DEVICE=pipewire

# This array arrives about 20 dB down, which sounds like a broken speaker
# rather than a quiet one. Turn it down here if it's too loud at night;
# leave it blank to not touch the system mixer at all.
OUTPUT_VOLUME=100

# The wake word, and how sure it has to be.
#
# This was 0.99, and 0.99 was costing about half the recall for nothing.
# Measured on the training bank, holding one child out of training entirely:
#
#     threshold   recall, unseen voice   recall, known voices
#       0.99              38%                    58%
#       0.90              52%                    94%
#       0.80              55%                   100%
#       0.50              66%                   100%
#
# and no measurable change in false wakes anywhere across that range. That
# last part turned out to be worthless: those negatives were mined against
# this same model, and the real room disagreed loudly. At 0.80 it woke
# roughly every twenty seconds with a television on — 108 an hour — so it
# was nearly always mid-turn and could not hear anybody. Measured in the
# room, the false wakes score HIGHER than the real ones (median 0.991
# against 0.933), so there is no clean cut anywhere; the threshold only
# buys rate, not separation.
#
# What makes a low threshold affordable is that a false wake is now silent:
# nothing said means nothing spoken, and television speech gets (nothing)
# back from Claude. It costs a flash of the LED ring and some CPU.
#
# Measure yours on the Pi itself, and read what it actually logged:
#     python train/test_wake.py --times 6
#     python src/wake_log.py
WAKE_MODEL=hey_claude_whisper.npz
# Left unset on purpose. A model fitted by train/relearn.py carries the
# operating point its own sweep chose, and two models are not comparable at
# a single number — they sit on different score distributions, so the same
# threshold means different things to each. Set this only to argue with the
# sweep.
# WAKE_THRESHOLD=0.95

# How often the Whisper wake word looks, in seconds. About 42% of one core
# at 0.4 on a Pi 4. Raise it to spend less, and be noticed a little later.
WAKE_STRIDE_SECONDS=0.4
