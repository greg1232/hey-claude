"""Listen to what woke the speaker, and say whether it was right.

    ./label.sh

Fetches the clips off the Pi, opens a page in your browser, and plays them
one at a time. One key each: **y** if that really was somebody saying the
wake word, **n** if it wasn't. Your answers go back to the Pi and are what
the nightly retraining learns from.

Why this exists
---------------
The speaker labels its own firings, and it is good at the easy half: a
firing followed by silence was the television, one followed by a question
that got answered was real. The hard half it guesses at, and the guesses
matter — the first retrained model, measured on firings held back from the
fitting, caught 85% of the real ones and fired on 43% of the mistakes,
which is very much worse than the model it would have replaced.

A person listening to thirty clips fixes that in five minutes. Labels from
here are appended after the automatic ones, so they win.

There is nothing to install and nothing runs on the Pi. It copies the
clips down, serves them from this machine, and appends your answers when
you're finished.
