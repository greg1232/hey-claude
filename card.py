"""Make an SD card that boots into a speaker you can reach.

    ./card.sh bedroom            prepare the card that's plugged in
    ./card.sh bedroom --flash    ...erasing it and writing 64-bit Pi OS first
    ./card.sh bedroom --password hunter2
    ./card.sh --find             what new Pi turned up on the network

It refuses a 32-bit card. That is not fussiness: ctranslate2, the engine
under faster-whisper, has no 32-bit ARM build, so a speaker on one has no
speech recognition and no wake word. --flash will put the right image on.

Flash Raspberry Pi OS onto a card however you like — Imager, dd, anything —
then run this with the card in the laptop. It writes the three files the Pi
needs to come up with a name, a user, a key and a network, and tells you
what the password is. Boot it, and `--find` will tell you where it landed.

Why not just use Raspberry Pi Imager's settings
-----------------------------------------------
Because they are not part of the image. Imager writes `custom.toml` *and*
adds `init=/usr/lib/raspberrypi-sys-mods/firstboot` to cmdline.txt, and the
hook is what reads the file. Flash the same image any other way and the
hook is absent, so `custom.toml` sits there being ignored for ever.

That was worth four trips to the card to learn, so it is written down here:

  custom.toml      ignored unless something invokes it. Not used.
  init=            do not. On this image
                   /usr/lib/raspberrypi-sys-mods/firstboot does not exist,
                   so the kernel comes up with no init and the Pi never
                   boots at all — silently, if it has no monitor.
  userconf.txt     works. A systemd service reads it and makes the user.
  ssh              works. Consumed on boot, so write it every time.
  systemd.run=     works, and is safe: it runs a script as a unit rather
                   than replacing init, so a broken script costs you the
                   script and not the machine.

And the one that is easy to get wrong: at `kernel-command-line.target`,
*NetworkManager is not running yet*. A firstrun script that calls nmcli
gets "NetworkManager is not running" for every line. So this one writes
configuration files instead, which need no daemon, and lets the reboot
pick them up.
