"""What the speaker has been asked for and cannot do yet.

    ./wishes.sh              read them
    ./wishes.sh --clear      forget them, once they're built or dismissed
    ./wishes.sh --json       the raw list, for feeding to something else

A child asking for something the speaker cannot do is the most useful thing
that happens to this project — a feature request from the only person whose
opinion counts, in his own words, at the moment he wanted it. The speaker
writes each one down (see src/wishes.py) and this fetches the lot.

Repeats are folded together and counted, because a thing asked for five
times is five times as interesting as a thing asked for once.

The obvious next step is to hand a wish to Claude Code and let it write the
tool — `docs/tools.md` is close to a specification for exactly that, and it
managed src/scores.py from a one-paragraph description on the first try.
What stops that being automatic is that the television reaches the
speaker's transcript about fifty times an hour, so the path from "somebody
said something in this room" to "code ran" needs a person in it. This
command is that person's end of it.
