"""Teaching the speaker a voice, by saying the wake word at it.

    "hey Claude, learn my voice"
    "Say hey Claude over and over, with a pause between each."
    "hey Claude ... hey Claude ... hey Claude ..."
    "I got nine. Give me a moment."     <- refits, reloads, done in seconds

This is the answer to recall. Held out entirely, the wake word catches
about half of one child's attempts, and the only cure for that is more
recordings of that child — which used to mean sitting down with
train/record_wake.py and a laptop. Now the speaker collects them itself, in
the room it lives in, through the microphone it actually listens with.

Nobody labels anything. The person was asked to say the wake word over and
over, so every segment is the wake word by construction. That is the whole
trick.

Two things guard against it learning rubbish:

  it must hear enough      three segments at least, or the recording is
                           thrown away rather than half-learned.
  they must resemble       each segment is turned into the same 768 numbers
  each other               the detector scores, and any that doesn't look
                           like the others is dropped. A cough, a door, a
                           sibling shouting — all outliers among ten
                           repetitions of one phrase.

The recordings are kept in state/, not in train/, because deploy mirrors
the project directory and would delete them.

    python src/enroll.py        record a round now, without the speaker
