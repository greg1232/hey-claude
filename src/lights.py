"""The LED ring on the microphone array — showing what the speaker is doing.

A speaker with no screen has one honest way to say "I heard you": the ring
of twelve LEDs around the microphone array. Sound can't do this job on its
own. The beep tells you it woke up, but it can't keep telling you it's
still listening, and it can't say anything at all while you're talking.

    dark        idle, waiting for the wake word
    blue        listening to your question
    blue, slow  thinking about it
    green       talking back
    red, fast   a timer is going off
    purple      learning your voice — keep saying it until this goes out

Everything here is best-effort. If the array isn't plugged in, or pyusb
isn't installed, or the udev rule was never added, the lights quietly stay
off and the speaker works exactly as before. A voice assistant should not
stop working because a light didn't.

How it talks to the array
-------------------------
The XVF3800 takes vendor USB control transfers: request 0, wValue is the
command, wIndex is the resource. The whole LED protocol is five commands,
so this speaks it directly rather than shipping Seeed's 1.8 MB xvf_host
binary or vendoring their 400-line script.

Permission
----------
The array's USB node is owned by root, so this needs a udev rule to work
without sudo. `./deploy.sh` installs one. Without it you get "Access
denied" once, and then the lights are off for the rest of the run.
