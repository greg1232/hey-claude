"""Text to speech — makes the speaker talk.

Which voice you get depends on the machine, and it's picked automatically:

  macOS          the built-in `say` command. Nothing to install.
  Linux (Pi)     Piper, a small neural voice that runs on the Raspberry Pi
                 itself, with espeak-ng as a last resort.

Piper was chosen for the Pi because it's the only good-sounding text to
speech that comfortably runs faster than real time on four Arm cores: a
medium voice takes about a third of a second of compute per second of
speech. The bigger, more expressive models — Chatterbox and its kind — need
over three gigabytes of weights before Python has even started, which is
more memory than the Pi has, and would take minutes per sentence here.
