"""Speech to text — turns a recording into words.

Uses faster-whisper, which runs locally on the laptop. Nothing is sent over
the internet, it costs nothing, and on Apple Silicon a short question is
transcribed in well under a second.

The first run downloads the model (about 150 MB for base.en) and caches it,
so it only happens once.
