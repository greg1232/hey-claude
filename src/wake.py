"""Wake word — waits for "Hey Claude".

There are two ways to wake the speaker up, and they have the same interface,
so main.py doesn't care which one is running:

  KeyWaker         press Enter to talk. Always works, no setup.
  WakeWordDetector listen for a spoken wake word using openWakeWord,
                   which runs locally on the laptop.

Pick with WAKE_MODE in .env: auto (default), key, or openwakeword.

A note on "Hey Claude": openWakeWord ships a few pre-trained wake words
(hey_jarvis, alexa, hey_mycroft) but not "Hey Claude" — you have to train
that one yourself. See docs/training-hey-claude.md for how.

Once you have the trained file, drop it in models/ and set this in .env:

    WAKE_MODEL=hey_claude.onnx

Nothing else has to change.
