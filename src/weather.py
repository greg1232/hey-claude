"""Today's weather, for the speaker to mention when asked.

Uses Open-Meteo, which is free, needs no API key and no account. Set
LOCATION in .env to switch it on:

    LOCATION=Palo Alto, California

Nothing here is allowed to slow down an answer. The forecast is fetched on
a background thread and cached; asking for it returns whatever was last
fetched, immediately, even while a refresh is in flight. If the network is
down or the location can't be found, it returns None and the speaker simply
doesn't know the weather — which is much better than a question hanging for
several seconds.

    python src/weather.py        print what the speaker would be told
