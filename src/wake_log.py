"""Every time the wake word fires, write down what fired it.

The wake word is wrong about forty times an hour with a television on, and
each of those mistakes is a labelled training example that nobody had to
record. This keeps them.

What gets kept, per firing:

  the 768 numbers  the vector the detector scored. Free — the encoder pass
                   that produced it is the expensive part and has already
                   happened by the time we know it fired. 1.5 kB.
  the two seconds  the audio itself, so a person can listen, and so the
                   features can be recomputed if the encoder ever changes.
                   64 kB, so only the most recent are kept.
  what happened    what Whisper heard afterwards, and whether Claude
                   thought it was being spoken to. Written after the turn,
                   because that's when we know.

The last of those is what makes this worth doing. A firing followed by
silence is almost certainly a mistake; one followed by "what's the weather"
is almost certainly real. The speaker already works both of those out in
the course of answering, and they cost nothing to write down.

Near misses
-----------
Logging only what fires would teach the speaker nothing about recall, and
recall is the weaker half — held out entirely, it catches 52% of one
child's attempts. The times somebody said "hey Claude" and nothing
happened are exactly the examples that would fix that, and they never fire,
so they would never be logged.

So windows that score close to the line are kept in memory for a few
seconds, and when a firing does happen the ones just before it are written
down too. That is the "I had to say it three times" case, and the person
repeating themselves is what labels it: a near miss followed within seconds
by a real wake word was almost certainly the same person saying the same
thing, missed. A slower sample is kept as well, for the attempts that were
never followed by success because whoever it was gave up.

Nothing here is allowed to slow a turn down or break one. Every call is
wrapped, and a full disk costs you the log, not the speaker.
