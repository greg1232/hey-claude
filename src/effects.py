"""Sound effects — real recordings, fetched when somebody asks for one.

    "hey claude, what does a bullfrog say"
    "hey claude, play the sound of a train whistle"

Unlike the background sounds in sounds.py, these can't be made from filtered
noise. A bullfrog is a bullfrog. So they are looked up, downloaded, cached
on disk, and played — and the second bullfrog is instant.

Where they come from
--------------------
Freesound, if you have a key. It is the good one: six hundred thousand
Creative Commons recordings, searchable, with ratings and durations to sort
by. A key is free from https://freesound.org/apiv2/apply/ and goes in .env
as FREESOUND_API_KEY.

Wikimedia Commons otherwise, which needs no key and no account. It works,
but its search is not built for this and the ranking shows it: "cow moo"
returns a 1922 jazz record called Atlanta Rag by Cow Cow Davenport, and
half the hits for any animal are dictionary pronunciations of the word.
Hence FALSE_FRIENDS below, which is not elegant and is entirely necessary.

Playing it
----------
Through the same arbitration as everything else: the microphone array is
one device, so this takes the speaker lock and steps the background sounds
aside, and sets `speaking` so the wake word can't hear the bullfrog and
wake up for it.

    python src/effects.py bullfrog       look one up and play it
    python src/effects.py --list         what's already cached

    "siren" returns Siren.ogg and an American police siren.

    So the words have to be tried separately — and which word matters
    cannot be guessed. This used to try them longest first, on the theory
