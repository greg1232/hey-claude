"""Timers and alarms — the only part of the speaker that talks first.

Everything else here answers a question. A timer interrupts, and that makes
it the awkward one: it goes off on its own thread, minutes after anybody
asked for it, quite possibly while somebody is in the middle of asking
something else.

Two locks keep that from turning into a mess:

  the turn lock   held by main.py for a whole question-and-answer. A timer
                  that comes due in the middle waits for the answer to
                  finish rather than talking over it — or worse, ringing
                  into the microphone while the question is being recorded,
                  where it lands in the recording and Whisper transcribes
                  the chime as a word.

  the state lock  guards the list itself, because the ringing thread and
                  the answering thread both touch it.

Alarms outlive a reboot; timers don't. Somebody setting a seven o'clock
alarm means it, and a Pi that lost power at four in the morning shouldn't
quietly drop it. A ten minute timer, on the other hand, is about something
happening right now, and an hour later it's just confusing.

    python src/timers.py        set a five second timer and wait for it
