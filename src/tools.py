"""Tools — the plumbing that lets Claude do things, not just talk about them.

This file is only the framework. It knows how to collect tools, describe
them to Claude, and run one safely. It knows nothing about timers or rain,
and adding a capability doesn't touch it.

A tool lives in the module that implements it. `timers.py` owns the timer
tools, `sounds.py` owns the ones that play rain, and each is one function
and one decorator next to the code it drives:

    import tools

    @tools.tool(
        "Turn the kitchen light on or off.",
        properties={"on": {"type": "boolean", "description": "..."}},
        required=["on"],
        says="turn the kitchen light on and off",
    )
    def set_kitchen_light(on: bool) -> str:
        ...
        return "The kitchen light is on."

Then add the module's name to FEATURES below. That is the whole of it —
the API description, the round trip, and the line in the system prompt
telling Claude the speaker can do it all follow from those two things.

Three rules for a tool:

  Return a sentence, not a data structure. Claude reads it and rephrases
  it for speaking, so plain English costs nothing and saves a translation
  step where things get lost.

  Never raise. A tool that throws would take the whole answer down with
  it; run() turns any exception into a sentence saying so, and Claude
  passes that on. A broken timer should cost you a timer, not the speaker.

  Be quick. Everything here happens while somebody stands there waiting.

`says` is what the speaker tells Claude it can do, in the same words a
person would use. It's generated from the tools rather than written out in
the prompt, because the prompt used to insist there were no timers on the
day timers were added.
