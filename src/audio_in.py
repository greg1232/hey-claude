One microphone stream stays open the whole time the program is running.
Audio arrives in small chunks and gets dropped into a queue. Both the wake
word detector and the question recorder read from that same queue, so the
device only has to be opened once.

While the speaker is talking, incoming audio is thrown away — otherwise it
hears its own voice and wakes itself up.
